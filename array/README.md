# Array

** Definition**

* An array is a linear data structure in which elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.
* Advantages:
    * Direct access via index is possible in O(1) time.
* Disadvantages:
    * Arrays are not dynamically sized – the size must be initialized at compile time.
    * Array insertion and deletion can be costly since elements must be shifted in memory.
