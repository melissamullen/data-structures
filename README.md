# Linked List

**Definition**

* A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are *not* stored in contiguous memory locations.
* A linked list is made up of nodes. Each node contains a piece of data and a pointer to the next node.
* Advantages:
     * Linked lists are dynamically sized – they can grow and shrink at runtime.
     * Linked lists allow for easy insertion and deletion.
* Disadvantages:
     * Linked lists require more memory than arrays.
     * Linked list traversal takes more time than array traversal – direct access via index is not possible.
     * Singly linked lists do not allow for reverse traversal.
